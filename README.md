# Unemployed Insurance Beneficiary Forecasting

A predictive analytics solution for forecasting unemployment insurance beneficiary counts, built as part of the Artificial Intelligence course from SmartBridge.

## ðŸš€ Introduction

"Unemployed Insurance Beneficiary Forecasting" is a predictive analytics project aimed at anticipating the number of individuals who will apply for and receive unemployment insurance benefits over a given period. By analyzing historical data, economic indicators, demographic trends, and labor market dynamics, this project seeks to provide accurate forecasts to government agencies, policymakers, and insurance providers, enabling them to allocate resources effectively and plan for future demand. The project leverages advanced time series analytics and machine learning to forecast the demand for unemployment insurance. It is designed to help government agencies, policymakers, and insurance providers with actionable insights for efficient resource allocation and planning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/unemployed-insurance-forecasting.git
cd unemployed-insurance-forecasting
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the data from the official source or use the provided sample dataset.
